# Environment ðŸŒ²
### Overall 
It is the mechanism SwiftUI uses to propagate values down the view tree, i.e. from a parent view to its contained subview tree.

### How the Environment Works

if print out the concrete type of the following view. 
```
var body: some View {
	VStack {
		Text("Hello World")
	}
	.font(Font.headline)
}
```

We can how the type changes: 

```
ModifiedContent<
VStack<Text>,
_EnvironmentKeyWritingModifier<Optional<Font>>
>
```

The type tells us that `.font` call that, an optional `Font` value is written to the environment. Since the environment is passed down the view tree, the textLabel within the stack can read the font value from the environment. 

- Even though setting a font on a vertical stack doesnâ€™t make immediate sense, the font setting is not lost; Itâ€™s preserved via the environment for any child view in the tree that might actually be interested in it. 
- The environment becomes especially useful when we want to modify multiple views at once. For example, 
```
VStack {
	Text("text 1")
	HStack {
		Text("text 2")
		Text("text 3")
	}.font(.largeTitle)
}
```

**The environment modifiers always only modify the environment of their direct subview tress and never the environment of sibling tress or parent views.** 

### Using the Environment 

- To make the custom control work nicely with both light appearance and dark appearance, weâ€™ll use SwiftUIâ€™s `colorScheme` environment value to read the current colour scheme setting from the environment and set the knobâ€™s coloraturas accordingly: 
```
struct Knob: View {
	@Binding var value: Double 
	@Environment(\.colorScheme) var colorScheme

	var body: some View {
		KnobShape()
		.fill(colorScheme == .dark ? Color.white : Color.black)
		.....
	}
}
```

`@Environment` properties act like `@State` properties: when the value changes, a view update is triggered. 

### Custom Environment Values

- Define a new type conforming to the `EnvironmentKey` protocol: 
```
fileprivate struct PointerSizeKey: EnvironmentKey {
		static let defaultValue: CGFloat = 0.1 
}
``` 
- Add a property to `EnvironmentValues` so that we can use it as a key path: 
```
extension EnvironmentValues {
	var knobPointerSize: CGFloat {
		get { self[PointerSizeKey.self] }
		set { self[PointerSizeKey.self] = newValue }
	}
}
```
- **Environment decouples reading a configuration value from setting that value. As a result, itâ€™s very easy to forget to set an environment value or to set it on the wrong view subtree. Itâ€™s better to start by exposing customisation options as simple view parameters, and then when noticing that a more decoupled API would be useful, itâ€™s easy to change the implementation to use an environment values as well.** 

### Dependency injection 
- The environment is usually used with value types: a view depends on an environment value via an `@Environment` property is only invalidated when a new environment value is set for the key in question, if we store an object in the environment and observe it with `Environment`, the view will not be  invalidated if a property of the object changes - this only occurs if the entirely different object is set. 
- `environmentObject(_:)` modifier for injecting objects.
- While the `@EnvironmentObject` pattern is useful, itâ€™s better to use `@Environment` with a key if itâ€™s possible to get away with passing a value type, because itâ€™s the safer mechanism: EnvironmentKey requires us to provide a default value. With @EnvironmentObject, it is almost too easy to end up with a hard crash if we forget to inject the object.

### Preferences 
- `Preference` system allows us to implicitly pass values from child views to a superview.
