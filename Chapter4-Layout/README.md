# Layout 🏠
### Overall 
- The view layout process has the task of assigning each view in the view tree a *position* and a *size*. 
- In SwiftUI, the algorithm its simple in principle: for each view in the hierarchy, SwiftUI proposes a size(*the available size*). The view lay itself out within that available space and reports back with its actual size. The system then centers the view in the available space. 

### Elementary Views 
#### Paths
- A **Path** is a list of 2D drawing instructions. When the layout method on Path is called, it always returns the proposed size as its actual size. If any of the proposed dimensions is nil, it returns a default value of 10. 
- A **Path** is absolute, it’s not resizable. 
#### Shapes 
- Shape protocol is used, when we want a **Path** to fit or fill the proposed size.
```swift
protocol Shape: Animatable, View {
	func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path
}
```

- Shapes without constrained aspect ratios, like **Rectangle**, draw themselves by filling up the entire available space
- **Circle** draw themselves to fit into the available space. 
- **Shape** can have modifiers. 
#### Images 
- By default, **Image** views have a fixed size - namely the size of the image in points. *Which means that the image view’s layout method ignores the size proposed by the layout system and always returns the image’s size*
- **.resizable**  will make it accept the proposed size and fit the image within the space. It is commonly combined with a call to **.aspectRatio** directly after.
- **.aspectRatio** modifier takes the proposed size and creates a new size that best fills the proposed size. 
#### Text
- By default, **Text** view’s layout method always tries to fit its contents in the proposed size, and it returns the bounding box of the rendered text as its result. 
- Common modifiers:
	- **fixedSize**: proposes nil as its size, and the text view becomes its ideal size. More importantly, this prevents line wrapping. This does mean that the text may draw outside of the size proposed to `FixedSize`.
	- **lineLimit** specifies the maximum number of lines. 
	- **minimumScaleFactor** allows Text to be rendered at a smaller font size(if the text doesn’t fit)
	- **TruncationMode** determines the truncation behaviour, i.e. whether the beginning, middle, or end is truncated.
